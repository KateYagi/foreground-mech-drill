# Foreground Only Mech Drill

A starbound mod that makes mech drill arms only break foreground blocks.

Replaces vehicles/modularmech/armscripts/drillarm.lua with a version that doesn't break background blocks. As such, it's incompatible with any mod that also replaces that file.

A .pak is provided in the releases, which should remain up-to-date for the foreseeable future since I dunno what else you could do to improve this concept, other than a .patch solution but I dunno if starbound's engine allows patching lua.
